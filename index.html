    <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions. It is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Common examples of AI include voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation systems on Netflix and Amazon, self-driving cars, and even chatbots. AI can analyze large amounts of data faster than humans, making it extremely useful in fields like healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI technologies are categorized into narrow AI (focused on a specific task) and general AI (machines that can perform any intellectual task like a human). While narrow AI is already widely used, general AI is still in the research stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      As AI continues to evolve, it brings both opportunities and challenges. Ethical considerations, job displacement, and data privacy are some of the concerns that must be addressed as we integrate AI more deeply into our lives.
